## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the [SDF10] API Learning Reflection! Through this exercise, you will reflect on key concepts, practical experiences, and the tools you've encountered or used in API interactions.

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

API stands for application programming interface. 
APIâ€™s allows two apps to communicate with each other using requests and responses.
APIs are an accessible way to extract and share data within and across organisations.

When I make payments on a website using PayPal, the website uses an API to communicate with the PayPal system, passing information such as the payment amount and my billing information.

2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API? 

The user interface (UI), which is what the user sees, and the backend application programming interface (API), used to communicate with the underlying application or system.
An API is the same thing as a UI, except that it is geared for consumption by software instead of humans.

3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

Main components - Endpoints, Methods and Data formats

Endpoints - 
An API endpoint is a specific location within an API that accepts requests and sends back responses. Itâ€™s a way for different systems and applications to communicate with each other, by sending and receiving information and instructions via the endpoint.

Methods -
HTTP methods are used to indicate the action anÂ API client would like to perform on a given resource.

Data formats - 
The data exchanged between clients and servers via APIs is structured in specific formats to ensure both sides can read and understand the data.

RESTful APIs

REST (Representational State Transfer) architecture, the server does not store any information about the client-side on the server-side.

REST APIs have aÂ 93.4% adoption rate, making it the most used API architecture among developers. REST is faster and more efficient than SOAP due to the smaller message sizes of REST. REST makes things simpler for developers by reducing the complexity of the application. The data in the database can easily be updated at any time using REST.
REST is stateless meaning that every HTTP request happens in complete isolation and every request will be processed and executed separately. 

REST provided a simple yet effective way to design web services that could scale with the growth of the internet. Its stateless nature, focus on resources, and use of standard HTTP methods made it a favourite among developers, leading to the widespread adoption of RESTful APIs in today's digital world.
RESTful APIs usually communicate using JSON, a lightweight data format that's easy to read and write.

4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs? 

Curl (client URL) is a command line tool for file transfer with a URL syntax. Curl lets you talk to a server by specifying the location and the data you want to send. 
Curl supports several different protocols, including HTTP and HTTPS, and runs on almost every platform. This makes curl ideal for testing communication from almost any device.

5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?

As of right now, I do not feel confident in any area relating to APIs. I will have to broaden my understanding by reading through the course content again a few more times, watch more YouTube videos to see more practical examples and read online articles relating to APIs.
